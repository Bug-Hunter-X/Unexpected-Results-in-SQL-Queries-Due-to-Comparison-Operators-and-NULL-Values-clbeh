```sql
-- Improved query to include employees with salaries equal to or greater than 100000
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' AND salary >= 100000;

-- For better clarity, explicitly checking for both NULL and non-NULL values might be necessary.
-- The meaning of NULL needs clarification in your database design. 
-- If NULL implies an incomplete order, add a flag or status column to indicate the completeness.

-- Example, assuming 'order_status' column indicates order completion:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE order_status = 'Incomplete'; 
-- Or checking for a NULL value explicitly:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE order_date IS NULL AND order_status IS NULL; -- If both are NULL, it indicates incompleteness

-- Alternatively, use COALESCE to replace NULLs with a default value for comparison.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE COALESCE(order_date, '1900-01-01') < CURRENT_DATE; --This assumes that any date before 1900-01-01 is an incomplete order
